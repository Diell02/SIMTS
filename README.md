# SIMTS - School Management System

SIMTS (Sistemi i Menaxhimit të Shkollës) is a School Management System project with a focus on providing comprehensive functionality for educational institutions.

## Features

- **Backend 14 Cruds & Frontend 14 Cruds:** Contains 14 fully functional CRUD operations that can be integrated into a School Management System.

- **User Management:** Backend and Frontend folders include a CRUD operation specifically designed for user management and login forms.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a School Management System with five distinct roles: student, teacher, psychologist, director, and parent. While the project is not 100% complete, significant progress has been made. The system incorporates features such as chat functionality between students and psychologists (work in progress), viewing grades, and adding grades.

### Current Status

- **Work in Progress:** The chat feature is still under development.

- **Role Functionalities:** The main challenge lies in functionalizing roles to ensure that each role has access to relevant functions. Currently exploring solutions to implement role-based functionalities, allowing actions based on user roles.

### Tutorials

Based on tutorials by Jason Watmore and Neil Cummings.

Feel free to explore and try out the system. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
