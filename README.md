SIMTS- School Management System (SIMTS- acronym from Albanian language "Sistemi i Menaxhimit të Shkollës")

Backend 14 Cruds & Frontend 14 Cruds folders contain 14 fully functional cruds that can be part of a SMS. 

Backend & Frontend folders contain only 1 crud which is about users and the login form. 

The idea of this project is a SMS that has 5 roles starting with the student, teacher, psychologist, director, and parent.
The project's not 100% functional but half of the hard work it's done. The starting idea was that this system it's like all the other
systems just that this one has an added feature, that is a chat between students with psychologists (This feature it's not done still).
Other features like view grades, add, etc are done and ready to be used. 
The main problem that I still didn't find a solution it's how to functionalize the roles so I can make functions valid by the role.
Trying to find a solution to this, and when I achieve it, I can easily make students, and parents only view the grades, teacher place them
and other functions like the director will add the students and staff, so you can't register by yourself. 
This is just a short description of the system, feel free to try it.
